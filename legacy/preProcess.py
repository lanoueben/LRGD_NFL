The purpose of this is to edit the "master.xlsx"
and to "Preprocess" the data. It will then 
create a new excel file that will 


This includes, first converting all the appropriate strings
into numbers/integers.
Next is to normalize the values. 
Win, year week won't be normalized.
The team name will also not be normalized (This will stay a string)
Normalization Scale formula:
    
x= instance of a field
xâ€™= normalized scaled value
xmin= the lowest value in the category (for all fields)
xmax=the high value in the category (for all fields)
xavg= mean value of the category
x' = (x-(xaverage)) / (xmax-xmin)

This will get an approximate range of -1<= x'<=1
which is desired

    columns = ["year","week","team","opponent","first downs", "rush", "rush yards", "rush td",
               "cmp", "att","pass yards", "pass td", "int", "sacks", "sack yards",
               "net yards", "total yards","fumbles", "fumble to", "to",
               "penalties", "penalty yards", "3 conversions","3 attempts",
               "4 conversions", "4 attempt", "min", "sec", "win"]
    
    
Before running this program, delete the current "masterPost.xlsx"
and create a new excel file, and name it "masterPost"
